Based on a quick Google search we get the following:

+ The expected values for normal fasting blood glucose consentration are
    between 70 - 100 mg/dL.

+ A healthy diastolic blood pressure is less than 80 mm Hg.
    Once you start getting below 60, that makes people feel uncomfortable.

+ In the study population, the average triceps skin fold thickness (TSF)
    was 18.7 ± 8.5 mm. Women have much higher TSF thickness than men:
        (23.6 ± 7.5 mm VS 14.3 ± 6.8 mm).

+ Using commercial assays, normal fasting insulin levels,
    range between 5 - 15 μU/mL.

+ Body mass index (BMI) (kg/ m)2. Self explanatory.



--- Getting zero as minimum value in the above attributes,
        based on the dataset's creation protocol,
            is the representation of missing values. ---
